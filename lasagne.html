            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>3.5 ounces prosciutto, chopped</li>
            <li>11 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>11 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>6 fluid ounces red wine</li>
            <li>21 ounces peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>0.6 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3.25 cups milk</li>
            <li>11 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2.5 cups grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.</li>
